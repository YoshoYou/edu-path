# React + Vite + Tailwind

After choosing a specific UI design,I try so hard to implemnts all the requires you asked us for to do in this projects.
I have some difficulties using React Router because this is my first time dealing with React-Router v6 and I have never been working on real project using it.I used useContext cause when  passing the course details cause course page is not a parent for course details but it works anyway.

I found some volnerability just in React-Router and JavaScript Logic so I'm working on it.
I choose the design from figma 
# you can run this app using : npm run dev

I'm looking for your feedback I hope you enjoy your journey  ^_ _ _^
